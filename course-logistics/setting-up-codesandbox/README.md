# 📓 Setting up CodeSandbox

![With CodeSandbox, you can create web apps, experiment with code, test ideas, and share creations easily.](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png>)

In order for teams to collaborate and develop code in the same environment, teams can choose to develop asynchronously (using Github as a central repository and a code editor like VSCode) or synchronously using sandboxes.

CodeSandbox is an online collaborative development environment with minimal set-up and zero cost. As long as you have a computer with an internet connection, you can write code and collaborate with anyone.

We use [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) in our Basics course for three reasons:

1\. **Collaborative Environment**- during in-class exercises, we practise pair programming in order to speed up learning and development and reduce cognitive load. CodeSandbox allows us to switch roles without the hassle of redeveloping the code on two separate computers.

> Pair programming consists of two programmers sharing a single workstation (one screen, keyboard and mouse among the pair). The programmer at the keyboard is usually called the “driver”, the other, also actively involved in the programming task but focusing more on overall direction is the “navigator”; it is expected that the programmers swap roles every few minutes or so.

2\. **Allows for Code Review** - Our Section Leaders (SL) will review your code commits on Github and give you feedback on your code quality and organisation of thought. Using CodeSandbox abstracts away the complexity of committing and pushing code onto GitHub via a Command-line Interface (CLI), thus reducing friction to learn!

3\. **A Portal into your Portfolio** - Developing on CodeSandbox is a breeze as it enables Hot-Reloading - you will be able to see the changes instantly, inline, as you code.

At the end of Basics, you will be able to showcase a ready-made portfolio to your friends and family through simple deployment steps within CodeSandbox. It will also be easy for anyone to test your code and see your thinking process - a plus if you are applying for jobs!
