# üîç Code Review

## Code Review

On days when projects are due, we will review each others' code in groups of 2 or 3 during class. If there is a group of 3, the triplet will do individual code review together so that everyone gets to review someone else's code, then split into 2 groups for pairing.

### 1. Run Partner's Code

Open the deployed link. How is the user experience? Are there cases where the application did not manage to detect?&#x20;

Open the code in the browser and test it. What does it do? If you're not sure what it does look inside `script.js` to see.

### 2. Read Partner's Code

Read the code:

1. How does it work?
2. Does it have any obvious errors?
3. Does it implement something that you were trying to do?
4. Does it implement a feature that you haven't started yet? How does the code work?

**Code Review Reflection Questions**

While you are reading, note down the answers to the following questions: No need to be comprehensive, but pick out parts of the code you found notable.

1. Note a line of code (or multiple lines) that you think works well. This could be the logic of the code, or just a well-named variable. Explain why it works well.
2. Note a line of code (or multiple lines) that you thought was unclear or you can't figure out. How would you explain why is it unclear or hard to figure out?
3. Note a line of code (or multiple lines) where you found a bug. Why is it a bug? Do you have a solution?

### 3. Edit Partner's Code

It may be helpful to make changes to the code to help you understand it better. Write some `console.log` that would help you figure out what the code does. Break the code in a certain way to prove how it works or doesn't work.

### 4. Discuss

Once both partners are done with #1-4, discuss what you saw. Read out and review together the answers to the 3 questions you wrote down from above.
