# ðŸ’¼ Submitting Your Work

At appropriate junctures during the course, your SLs will request for your submission for the respective projects. You will need to submit the latest PR that you have made for your project on Google Forms, so that your SLs can give you feedback on your code.

Doing so would help facilitate code review, since our SLs have a lot of code to read! If you have a last-minute change to your code, you can resubmit the form with your updated PR link!

### Submission

* [ ] Input your name and section (required)
* [ ] Submit your PR link. It should be in the following format

`https://github.com/<USER>/<REPO_NAME>/pull/`
