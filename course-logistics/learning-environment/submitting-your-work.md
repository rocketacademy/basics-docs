# ðŸ’¼ Submitting Your Work

At appropriate junctures during the course, your SLs will request for your submission for the respective projects. You will need to submit **the latest 'commit'** that you have made for your project on **your section's Slack channel**, so that your SLs can give you feedback on your code.

Doing so would help facilitate code review, since our SLs have a lot of code to read! If you have a last-minute change to your code, you can resubmit the form with your updated PR link!

### Submission

* [ ] Submit your repo link on Slack. It should be in the following format:

`https://github.com/<USER>/<REPO_NAME>/`

## Guide

### 1. Save Your Changes

1. Check that your file is saved by looking for the "X" on the specific tab of the script.js file that you have been working on. This is in contrast to a filled "O" that indicates that a file is unsaved!

### 2. Link your Sandbox if it is not linked
