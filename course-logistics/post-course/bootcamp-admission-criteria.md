# ðŸš‚ Bootcamp Admission Criteria

The knowledge taught in SWE Fundamentals are pre-requisite for entrance into Rocket Academy's Bootcamp.&#x20;

Section leaders can share feedback with students each class on their progress if you ask. By the end of Basics, students should be aware of their ability to enroll in the Bootcamp.

The criteria to pass SWE Fundamentals and join Bootcamp are the following.

1. **Completion and submission** of the 3 projects in SWE Fundamentals
2. Demonstrated improvement between each of the 3 projects based on section leader feedback
3. Pass [Rocket's Video Application](bootcamp-video-application.md)

Projects will be evaluated in this manner:

1. Proficiency with technical syntax (variables, functions, conditionals, loops, data structures) and tools (VSCode, Git, GitHub, Chrome DevTools)
2. Code quality (naming, code comments)
3. Computational thinking (i.e. ability to translate application requirements to code)
   1. Decomposition: Each function performs 1 conceptual operation
   2. Data Representation: Use of relevant data structures for each problem
   3. Abstraction: Re-use helper functions with varying parameter values when possible
   4. Algorithms: Construct stepwise logic to accomplish tasks

Through the above criteria, Rocket is essentially asking the question: Would I hire this person as a software engineer if I had their attention for 4 months full time or 8 months part time to teach them coding. If the answer is yes, welcome to Bootcamp! If the answer is currently no, let's have a conversation and see how we can help you get where you want to be!
