# ðŸš‚ Bootcamp Admission Criteria

## Introduction

Completing Coding Basics is highly recommended before joining Software Engineering Bootcamp. The course, whether self-served or led by an instructor, is aimed to get you comfortable with key fundamentals that would be necessary for the Bootcamp journey. However, for students who have had some prior experience, we welcome you to apply for our Bootcamps directly.&#x20;

In this section, we would introduce you to the basic requirements needed to join our Bootcamp.

Happy applying!

### Admission Criteria

The Application process is split into two sections:

1. Completion and submission of Basics project 3: [Blackjack](../../coursework/projects/project-3-blackjack/#introduction)
2. Submission of a video application, details can be found [here](bootcamp-video-application.md#introduction)

After completion of the above items, please submit your application [here!](https://forms.gle/oHjJt5zEm7wW1xMGA)

### Assessment Matrix

The following attributes are used to evaluate submissions:

1. Proper use of technical syntax as taught in Basics, or to an equivalent degree of proficiency
2. Communication ability to clearly articulate concepts, with a strong command of English
3.  Computational thinking (the ability to translate application requirements to code)



The above assessments are not designed to prevent anyone from joining us in Bootcamp, but simply to ensure that we are able to provide a more engaging and interactive learning experience with individuals excited to embark on their software engineering journey as you are!

However, if youâ€™re not ready at this moment, reach out to us, letâ€™s have a conversation and discuss how we can get you ready to rock into your software engineering journey!
