## Required GUI-Application Software

GUI-application software is software we run with a graphical user interface (GUI) on our operating system.

### Messaging Platform

The Rocket LMS platform (rocket.disco.co) provides community channels for real-time but asynchronous messaging that should feel casual and fun. We have provided with a selection of channels, e.g. `#general` for you to keep in touch with your classmates and instructors.

#### Onboarding

There are 2 stages to onboard a new student:
1. Join the Rocket Academy community at https://rocket.disco.co as a member
2. Join the Coding Fundamentals (PF1) Learning Experience product assigned to them

Once a student joins the community as a member, they can register to join the various learning products that they will be assigned to.
