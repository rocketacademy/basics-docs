# ðŸŽ² Exercises and Projects

## Exercise, Project Strategy

Please read through all sections of exercises and projects before starting. Later parts of exercises and projects may require different code architecture than earlier parts. **Failure to take into consideration all aspects of the project might result in a lengthy refactor.**

### Base, Comfortable, More Comfortable

To accommodate different learning speeds and prior experience, exercises and projects may have different sections to differentiate what must be completed to minimally understand concepts, and what are extra exercises or features to help solidify one's understanding.

#### Base

Everything in the Base section must be completed to minimally understand relevant concepts. When short on time, we can complete the Base section then move onto the next exercise or project.

#### More Comfortable

The More Comfortable section is for students that wish to push their boundaries. Students can complete Coding Basics without touching More Comfortable.&#x20;

## Project Presentations

Students present projects in class on the last day of each project. Presentations should cover the following.

1. Demo
2. Biggest challenges faced
3. What they might do differently next time

In order to keep each presentation relatively brief, the presentation should be focused around the _features_ of the game. The presentation is not a code review, as that would take up too much time.

## Code Review

On days when projects are due, we will review each others' code in groups of 2 or 3 during class. If there is a group of 3, the triplet will do individual code review together so that everyone gets to review someone else's code, then split into 2 groups for pairing.

### Individual Review

#### 1) Exchange CodeSandbox links

You may follow the instructions here:

{% content-ref url="../learning-environment/pair-programming-instructions.md" %}
[pair-programming-instructions.md](../learning-environment/pair-programming-instructions.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

#### 2) Run Partner's Code

Test the code in the sandboxed browser. What does it do? If you're not sure what it does look inside `script.js` to see.

#### 3) Read Partner's Code

Read the code and answer the following questions.

1. How does it work?
2. Does it have any obvious errors?
3. Does it implement something that you were trying to do?
4. Does it implement a feature that you haven't started yet? How does the code work?

#### 4) Play with Partner's Code

It may be helpful to make changes to the code to help you understand it better. Write some `console.log` that would help you figure out what the code does. Break the code in a certain way to prove how it works or doesn't work.

#### 5) Discuss

Once both partners are done with #1-4, discuss what you saw.

### Peer Review

You'll be pair programming on one person's project at a time. The goal is to get working versions for each person. **The driver will be the person who is \*not\* working on their own code.**

Once done with one person's code, send the code to your pair (it's their project) via a [Slack code snippet](https://slack.com/intl/en-sg/slack-tips/share-code-snippets). Switch to work on the other person's code.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: If you are working on your partner's code you can't push to their repo because GitHub repos are read-only to non-owners by default.
{% endhint %}

If you both have working versions, implement a new feature in one of the projects together.
