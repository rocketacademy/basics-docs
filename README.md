# ðŸš€ Course Overview

## Welcome to Coding Basics!

[Coding Basics](https://rocketacademy.co/courses/basics) is Rocket Academy's introduction to software programming, also known as coding. In this course we will learn basic coding syntax and concepts through building simple programs. Students interested in software engineering careers can join Rocket's [Software Engineering Bootcamp](https://rocketacademy.co/courses/bootcamp) after Basics to build more complex programs and get a software engineering job.

## How will Basics work?

1. Students have the option to complete Basics in a self-serve or guided manner. Students that wish to self-serve can go through the course material on their own, making sure to complete each of the 3 projects. The guided course is 5 weeks long with 10 meetings of 2 hours each and roughly 10 hours of work per week.
2. Students will write code in a browser-based code editor with starter code provided by Rocket. We will primarily code in the JavaScript language, the world's most popular programming language, but the concepts we learn will be applicable to almost all programming languages.
3. Students will learn primarily by writing code. Lectures are pre-recorded, guided class sessions are spent coding with peers, and students will spend most time working on exercises and projects outside of class.

## What will Basics cover?

1. Variables, data types and data structures
2. Functions and errors
3. Conditionals and loops
4. Variable scope
5. HTML and CSS
6. Document Object Model (DOM)

## What will Basics not cover?

The following topics are covered in depth in Rocket's Software Engineering Bootcamp and not in Coding Basics. This helps keep Basics accessible to all learners.

1. Production-level app-building and software architecture
2. Algorithms such as those used for coding interviews
3. Command line, Git, GitHub, desktop-based code editors like VSCode
