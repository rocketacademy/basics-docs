# ðŸš€ Course Overview

## Welcome to SWE Fundamentals!

SWE (Software Engineering) Fundamentals, is Rocket Academy's intro course in software programming, also known as coding. You will learn basic coding syntax and concepts through building simple programs. Students interested in software engineering careers can continue with Rocket's [Coding Bootcamp](https://www.rocketacademy.co/courses/bootcamp-course) after SWE Fundamentals to build more complex applications and start on a career as a software engineering.

If you are interested in understanding what is required to attend our Bootcamp, please refer to the ['Bootcamp Admission Criteria' page](course-logistics/post-course/bootcamp-admission-criteria.md).

### Goals of SWE Fundamentals

To impart Computational Thinking through programming. Programming being the act of writing lines of code that work cohesively to create a much larger intended effect.&#x20;

We aim to introduce the elements of constructing a program and thinking about how it should work in a short (6 weeks, 12 meetings) amount of time. This occurs within a "sandbox" JavaScript environment meant to focus on the universal, fundamental concepts of programming, instead of the specificities of the JavaScript language. Using project and mastery based learning it aims to incrementally level-up students' coding knowledge through fun game-based mini projects.

### What SWE Fundamentals is not?

It focuses primarily on project-based learning, and NOT cover theoretical computer science concepts; universal programming fundamentals and NOT cover software systems or code frameworks as they are deployed in a commercial setting.
