# ðŸš€ Course Overview

## Welcome to Coding Basics!

[Coding Basics](https://rocketacademy.co/courses/basics) is Rocket Academy's introduction to programming.&#x20;

In this course we will learn basic coding concepts through building simple programs. Students interested in software engineering careers can [apply](course-logistics/post-course/bootcamp-admission-criteria.md) to join Rocket's [Software Engineering Bootcamp](https://rocketacademy.co/courses/bootcamp) after Basics to build more complex programs and get a software engineering job.

## What will Basics cover?

Basics aims to incrementally level-up students' coding knowledge through fun game-based mini projects. This happens in a "sandbox" environment meant to focus on the universal, fundamental concepts of programming, rather than being specific to the any one language.&#x20;

Coding Basics consists of 6 Modules and 3 Projects.

## What will Basics not cover?

Coding Basics does not cover entry-level Computer Science. At Rocket Academy, you will be learning via a middle-out approach, and you will learn by doing. This course will not deep dive into _how or why_ a computer operates. [Computer Science is to programming what organic chemistry is to cooking](https://blog.codegiant.io/building-a-software-is-like-cooking-food-a64461a2e791?gi=ddfba8e218fc). If this was a cooking course, we will be teaching you how to cook an omelet, not why the egg fries at a certain temperature. You will also likely make a mess.

The following areas are covered in depth in Rocket's Software Engineering Bootcamp and not in Coding Basics:

1. Industry-standard, production-level app building and software architecture.
2. Advanced data structures and algorithms, such as those relevant for coding interviews.
