# Scissors Paper Stone Redux

## Objectives

1. Play partner's game on your machine.
2. Read partner's code.
3. Edit and discuss code together.
4. Improve each other's projects.

### Engage in Peer Code Review

### Improve Project Together

You'll be pair programming on one person's project at a time.

**The driver will be the person who is \_not**\_\*\* working on their own code.\*\*

Once done with one person's code, send the code to your pair (it's their project) via a [Slack code snippet](https://slack.com/intl/en-sg/slack-tips/share-code-snippets). Switch to work on the other person's code.

Note: If you are working on your partner's code you can't push to their repo because their CodeSandboxes are read-only to non-owners by default.
{% endhint %}

Work on the game in the following order:

### 1. Fix Errors

If there are any errors or bugs in a project, pair to fix those problems.

### 2. Add Features

If there were any features you wanted to implement but couldn't, use this time to pair-program your desired features, or anything else you'd like to see in your game.

If you have nothing else to add, here are some ideas:

#### A) Multi Game - Guess the Word

Your pair will turn the Scissors Paper Stone game into a Multi game app. Add a mode for a new "guess the secret word" game. The user will type in "word game" (or any secret phrase of your choice) to switch to this mode.

The game itself will be the same as the game in the code example in [4.1](../../../modules/3-logic-and-control-flow/3.2-conditionals/#simple-conditional-example-secret-phrase)

#### B) Dice Game

Add a third mode to the super game, a guess the dice roll game. The user will enter "dice game" to switch to this mode. (The dice game is the same dice game as the original basic version in [4.1](../../../modules/3-logic-and-control-flow/3.2-conditionals/#dice-game)).

### 3. More Comfortable

Continue to add to the Scissors Paper Stone game. Complete the [version 1 more comfortable](project-1-scissors-paper-stone-part-1.md#more-comfortable) or [version 2 more comfortable](project-1-scissors-paper-stone-part-2.md#more-comfortable) features that haven't been implemented yet.
