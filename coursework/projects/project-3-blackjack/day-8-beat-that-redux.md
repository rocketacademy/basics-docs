### Improve Project Together

You'll be pair programming on one person's project at a time. The goal is to get working versions for each person. **The driver will be the person who is \*not\* working on their own code.**

Once done with one person's code, send the code to your pair (it's their project) via a [Slack code snippet](https://slack.com/intl/en-sg/slack-tips/share-code-snippets). Switch to work on the other person's code.

Note: If you are working on your partner's code you can't push to their repo because their CodeSandboxes are read-only to non-owners by default.

### 1. Fix Errors

If there are any errors or bugs in a project, pair to fix those problems.

### 2. Add Features

If there were any features you wanted to implement but couldn't, use this time to pair-program your desired features, or anything else you'd like to see in your game.

If you both have working versions, implement a new feature in one of the projects together.

### 3. More Comfortable

Implement [More Comfortable exercises](./#more-comfortable) in the project write-up.&#x20;
