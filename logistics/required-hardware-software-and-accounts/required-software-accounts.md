### GitHub

GitHub is the most popular code-hosting platform. You can think of it as a **public "Google Drive", but for code**. Developers around the world use GitHub to share code and collaborate on projects. Rocket Academy's starter code and project templates are hosted on GitHub, and we will use GitHub in Coding Basics as the hosting repository for the assignments. Each student will need a GitHub account to host and submit the assignment code.

#### **Sign Up**

Go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com), click the `Sign Up` button and follow on-screen instructions.

### CodeSandbox

CodeSandbox allows developers to simply go to a URL in their browser to start coding. This not only makes it easier to get started, but it also makes it easier to share. Its integration with Github allows you to **preview and interact with the files that are hosted on your public "Google Drive".** You can just share your created work by sharing the URL, others can then (without downloading) further develop on these sandboxes. It is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that allows developers to collaborate on projects in the same workspace. It also offers a hot-reload browser to provide real-time previews of any code changes.

For this basic course, all the coding will be done in CodeSandbox
