# ðŸ”Ž Accessing Different Lessons File

### Objectives

* [ ] Understanding the file and folder structure of the starter code.

## Instructions

As the course will be run completely on CodeSandBox, all the necessary files that you require are present in the Starter Code you previously [forked](initial-setup.md). As there are multiple `index.html` files and `script.js` files, you will have to follow these simple steps to access the pages. &#x20;

* [ ] To access the `index.html`, open up the sandbox from the [initial setup](initial-setup.md)
* [ ] Click on the `Open in new Window`
