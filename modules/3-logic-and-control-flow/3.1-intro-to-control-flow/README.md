# 3.1: Intro to Control Flow

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

1. Understand that code does not always execute linearly and why
2. Identify statements and operators we can use to manipulate control flow
3. Know how logic is used to make programs more complex

## Introduction

So far our apps have always performed the _same operations_, no matter the input. The next level of complexity is to create programs that perform _different_ operations, depending on the input.

### What is Logic?

Programming logic is the ability of the computer to **make decisions** based on input data. \
\
We'll be using the JavaScript logic syntax, the `if, else if, else` conditions. \
This allows us selectively run different blocks of logic under different conditions.

This can be used to test values that the users are typing in. Depending on what the user types, we can program different outputs to be displayed in the grey box.



## Comments

As our apps get more complicated, we can and should leave notes to ourselves and others to clarify what our code does. "**Comments**" let us write notes in our code files that are ignored on program execution. In JavaScript, comments are denoted by 2 slashes `//` at the start of the comment.&#x20;

```javascript
// This is an example comment. It won't actually "run".
```
