# 3.4.2: For-loops

## Learning Objectives

* [ ] Be familiar with both the `for`-loop and `while`-loop syntax.

## For Loops

Most languages have variations on the while loop above that behave similarly. One common variation is the "for loop". For loops are a more concise syntax for looping over a fixed number of iterations. Whenever we have a fixed number of iterations we should use a for loop if possible. The 2 following examples behave the same, but the for loop syntax is more concise.

### While Loop Syntax

```javascript
// Initialise counter
var counter = 0;

// Declare loop condition
while (counter < 10) {
  console.log('hello');

  // Increment counter
  counter += 1;
}
```

### For Loop Syntax

```javascript
// Initialise counter, declare loop condition, and increment counter in 1 line
for (var counter = 0; counter < 10; counter += 1) {
  console.log('hello');
}
```

The key difference in for-loop syntax is that **all loop management code is consolidated in the top parenthesis group**. However, when the code runs, each step actually **happens in the same order as in the while loop example**. These steps are the following.

1. Declare and initialise a counter variable
2. Evaluate condition
3. Increment counter

To solidify understanding of loops, we suggest using while loops until you are comfortable with loop mechanics.

In other code examples, you may see the incrementation step replaced by `counter++`. This adds 1 to `counter`. At Rocket, we prefer ESLint's recommendation of `counter += 1` syntax. See ESLint's reasons against `++` syntax [here](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-plusplus).

### Nested For Loop Syntax

We can also next for loops to represent more than 2 dimensions. Conventionally, instead of using the `counter` variable, `i, j, k` are used to communicate clearly and succinctly the dimension the loops are at. Typically, 2 dimensions of loops is sufficient, anymore than 2 nested for loops are rare.&#x20;

```javascript
var main = function (input) {
  var myOutputValue = '';
  
  for (var i = 0; i < input; i += 1){
    // The 'i' loop runs input number of times
    for (var j = 0; j < input; j += 1){
      // The 'j' loops runs input number of time each then 'i' increments
      // Each time the inner loop runs, it adds "x" to output
      myOutputValue = myOutputValue + 'x';
      
      console.log('j :', j)
    }
    // At the end of each 'i' loop, add a <br> tag to begin a new row
    myOutputValue = myOutputValue + '<br>';
    console.log('i :', i)
  }
  
  // After the outer loop has run to completion, return the output compiled
  // by the above loops.
  return myOutputValue;
};
```

\
The code above is the [Nested Loops to Simulate Dimensions](3.4.2-for-loops.md#nested-loops-to-simulate-dimensions) example written in for loops, this is much shorter and cleaner as the variables are internalised in the for-loop statements.

When you are certain of the number of times you want to loop, for-loops are often used. However, while-loops are still utilised in situations where the number of iterations is not fixed. For example, if we wanted to roll 2 dice to generate 2 unique numbers, we could theoretically roll an infinite number of times. In this case, a while-loop is required. The pseudocode could look something like this:

```
// Generate the first random number between 1-6 
// Generate a second random number between 
// Check if the numbers are the same,
// if the numbers match, generate a new second random number
// repeat from line 3
```
