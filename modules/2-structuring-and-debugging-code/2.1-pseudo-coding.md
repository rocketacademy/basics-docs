# 2.1: Pseudocoding

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

1. Explain why pseudocode can be helpful
2. Be able to use simple pseudocode to help you write programs

## Introduction

We will learn about "**pseudocode**", a common method to plan logic before writing code.

## Pseudocode: Logical Expression Translation

As our code gets more complex, we will often want to plan our logic before writing code. This helps clarify our thoughts such that our code is more organised and we spend less time debugging.

### The Importance of Pseudocode

Pseudocoding is an important intermediate step to translate program requirements to code, helping us minimise logical errors. Before coding any program, try to translate program requirements into plain-English logical statements in code-comment format, then fill in your code beneath each line of pseudocode.

Almost all developers pseudocode, regardless of seniority. Even when we may not need pseudocode to develop a program correctly, others reading our code will find it helpful to read the pseudocode.
