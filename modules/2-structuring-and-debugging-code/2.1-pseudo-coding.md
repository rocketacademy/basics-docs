# 2.1 Pseudo Coding

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

* Explain why writing pseudo-code can be helpful, and know how to write simple psuedo-code.

## Introduction

We will also learn about "**pseudo-code**", a common method to plan logic before writing code.

## Pseudo-Code: Logical Expression Translation

As our code gets more complex, we will often want to plan our logic before writing code. This helps clarify our thoughts such that our code is more organised and we spend less time debugging.



### The Importance of Pseudo-Code

Pseudo-coding is an important intermediate step to translate program requirements to code, helping us minimise logical errors. Before coding any program, try to translate program requirements into plain-English logical statements in code-comment format, then fill in your code beneath each line of pseudo-code.

Almost all developers pseudo-code, regardless of seniority. Even when we may not need pseudo-code to develop a program correctly, others reading our code will find it helpful to read the pseudo-code.
