# 2.3.2: Functions II

### Functions Can Have Multiple Input Parameters

Functions can accept more than 1 input parameter, and input parameters are assigned based on position in the input parameter list, _not_ by variable name.

For example, if we define a function with syntax like the following,

```javascript
// function that takes in two names, and returns a message
var jobApplication = function (jobTitle, companyName) {
    var message = `To whom it may concern, I would like to submit my application for ${jobTitle} at ${companyName}.`;
    return message;
};
```

and we execute it with the following,

```javascript
jobApplication(userJobInput, userCompanyInput);
```

then when the `jobApplication` function is called , `userJobInput` will be assigned to `jobTitle` and `userCompanyInput` will be assigned to `companyName`. The parameter assignment has nothing to do with the name of the input variables, and everything to do with the order of the variables passed into the function.&#x20;

This allows us to give meaningful, and different variable names within the "scope" of function definition, and the "scope" of where the function is called in the main program. This also ensures we will not run out of variable names when writing long, complex code with many functions. We will learn more about Scope in [Module 4.](../../4-scope/)

## Exercises (Base)

For each exercise try to encapsulate each distinct operation inside a function that returns a value. For example, `daysToMinutes(3)` is a function that converts days to minutes, takes a number of days as input, and returns a number of minutes.

### **Juice Wedding**

It takes 4 oranges to make a 90ml glass of orange juice. When planning your wedding, you need to know how many oranges to buy so all your guests have 1 glass of juice. The user will enter a number of guests and the app will say how many oranges are needed and how many litres of orange juice you would get.

### **SG Hugs**

Everyone has a different gauge for how long they like to hug. The user can enter a number of seconds they like to hug on average, and the app will calculate how many years it will take to hug everyone in Singapore. You are allowed 9 hours a day to sleep and eat. ([Ref Solution](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-starter-code/tree/5.1-refSolns-sgHugs))

### **House Paint**

Estimate the price of painting the interior of your home. The user will enter a dollar amount of paint per litre and the app will calculate how much it will cost.

\
Each room in your 6-room house has the same area to be painted: 3m x 3m. There are 6 windows and 8 doors in your designer home. Coincidentally, windows and doors all of the same size: 90cm x 150cm. Paint will cover 300 square meters per litre. You want to apply 2 coats of paint. ([Ref Solution](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-starter-code/tree/5.1-refSolns-housePaint))

### **Train Speed**

Two trains are leaving to Tokyo. Train 1 is traveling 200kph, and will reach Tokyo in 2 hours. Train 2 is newer and can travel faster, but is delayed due to a signalling fault. Build an app for Train 2's conductor calculate how fast Train 2 needs to travel to arrive at Tokyo at the same time as Train 1, based on how long it was delayed. Output the speed in kph.

## **Exercises (More Comfortable)**

### **Clock**

A user can enter the number of minutes past 1pm and the app will calculate the angle between the hour and minute hand. You are free to decide how else your clock will work: if the minute hand moves in 5 minute increments or moves every second, etc.
