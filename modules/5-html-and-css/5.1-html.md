# 5.1: HTML

## Why HTML

HTML pages and the software that transfers them are the foundation of the browser-based internet. A browser's fundamental task is to display HTML documents and handle built-in HTML behaviours.

### What is HTML

This is a brief overview of HTML5 and how to use it. This intro will cover basic tags, classes and IDs. It is important to understand what HTML is and how it is used in browsers. All browsers have an HTML engine built in that can read and interpret the syntax in an HTML file. The tags tell the browser what type of elements are on the page and also how those elements relate to each other. Just like an editor would mark up content of an article, a programmer can mark up a web page by using tags and attributes. The first thing to learn is the proper syntax of a basic HTML page. HTML uses tags wrapped around content to control the flow and look. For example, a paragraph tag is used to surround the text of the paragraph and let the browser know that it is a paragraph. The browser then applies its default styling to the paragraph. The paragraph tag looks like this:

```html
<p>Text of the paragraph</p>
```

the p is called the opening tag and the /p is called the closing tag. Both must be included to tell the browser where the paragraph begins and ends. What is written between the tags is displayed on the browser page, not the tags. Most tags have an opening and closing tag with the content in between. Tags are generally nested inside each other to maintain structure and flow of content.

### Intro To CSS

In the beginning was html and only html. But programmers wanted to add styling to their web pages to help distinguish themselves from others on the web. Initially, this was not possible. But in October 1994, Håkon Wium Lie introduced Cascading Style Sheets to the world. Today it is better known as CSS.

Built on top of HTML to add more visual control and complexity, CSS specifies styles on an HTML element or set of elements. The CSS code specifies visual properties unrelated to the written content on an HTML page. In practice there are 2 uses for CSS: element styling and layout.

#### Element Styling&#x20;

CSS helps us change visual properties of HTML elements, such as fonts, background images, or rounded corners on buttons. Together with JS DOM manipulation, we can use CSS to implement visual logic within an application, such as hiding or showing cards and flipping elements 90 degrees.&#x20;

#### Layout&#x20;

CSS can help us divide our UI into visual sections. This is one of the most tricky aspects of CSS, because CSS was not originally intended for layout design. CSS content in RA's Bootcamp will focus on implementing UI layouts.

CSS is a declarative language. It doesn't tell the browser what to do but rather describes the rules that the browser then uses to render the page. CSS became popular because it was predictable and forgiving in its syntax. It was also easy to learn.\
The concept of cascading styles is unique to CSS. To cascade means that styles can inherit and overwrite styles through its hierarchy called specificity. More on that in section 2. This concept also allowed for many style sheets to be applied to one page. That is what made CSS so popular.

As a declarative language, CSS uses selectors and declarations to apply styling rules to HTML pages. The syntax for CSS starts with a selector which tells the browser the rules for styling the selected elements. Then a declaration code block is created using open and closing curly braces. Inside the declaration code block rules are created. A rule is made up of a property name followed by a colon and then the value of the property followed by a semi-colon. You can have as many rules as needed. It is the standard to put each rule on its own line in code. The semi-colon tells the browser that the end of the line is reached so be sure to add it at the end of every rule.

#### Sample Syntax

```css
selector{
	property: value;
	property: value;
}
```

In Basics, you will apply CSS styling in two ways:

1. in-line
2. internal

#### In-Line Styling

**In-line styling** is written inside the HTML opening tag as an attribute-value pair. Like this:

```html
<p style=“color: red;”> This text would be red </p>

```

If more than one style declaration is applied:

```html
<p style=“color: red; font-weight: bold;”> This text is red and bold</p>

```

#### Internal Styling

**Internal styling** is placed inside the head tag of the page and is wrapped inside the style tag. In this example, the selector of p is chosen to style all the paragraph tags on the page.

```html
<html>
   <head>
      <title> Page Title </title>
         <style>
            p{			
               color: white;
            }
         </style>
   </head>
   <body>
	<p> This text is white </p>
   </body>
</html>
```

You will be using internal styling in your exercises.  **Don't forget to put your CSS declarations between style tags.**
