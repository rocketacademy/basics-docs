## Introduction

We've completed the basics of how to code with JavaScript. Our hope is that you have some idea of how a program goes from conception to working code.

This module is only an introduction to HTML and CSS. HTML and CSS are the building blocks of everything you _see_ on the _web_. HTML and CSS are **not** programming languages, as they do not involve _logic._ HTML is the raw data that makes up a webpage: tables, lists, input and output boxes. CSS is adds style to the raw data. However, we may want to apply the programming logic we have learnt to manipulate and change what is displayed on the browser.&#x20;

## Why HTML

HTML pages and the software that transfers them are the foundation of the browser-based internet. A browser's fundamental task is to display HTML documents and handle built-in HTML behaviours. A HTML file to a web browser is akin to an .mp3 file to an audio player.

### What is HTML

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. In the same way you can [use certain tags](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/chats/how-to-format-your-messages/?lang=fi) to make words **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~ in a text messaging app like WhatsApp, HTML defines tags that mark-up plaintext files to be formatted differently when opened by a browser application.

All browsers have an HTML engine built in that can read and interpret the syntax in an HTML file.&#x20;

Tags tell the browser what type of elements are on the page and also how those elements relate to each other. Just like an editor would mark up content of an article, a programmer can mark up a web page by using tags and attributes.&#x20;

The first thing to learn is the proper syntax of a basic HTML page. HTML uses tags wrapped around content to control the flow and look.&#x20;

For example, a paragraph tag is used to surround the text of the paragraph and let the browser know that it is a paragraph. The browser then applies its default styling to the paragraph. The paragraph tag looks like this:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/html elements.png>)

the p is called the opening tag and the /p is called the closing tag. Both must be included to tell the browser where the paragraph begins and ends. What is written between the tags is displayed on the browser page, not the tags. Most tags have an opening and closing tag with the content in between. \

Tags are generally nested inside each other to maintain structure and flow of content.
