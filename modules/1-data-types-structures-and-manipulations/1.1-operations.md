# 1.1: Operations

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

* [ ] Use mathematical operators _****_ to perform mathematical operations in the console of your browser.

## Introduction

Coding means writing instructions for the computer to execute. We will begin with the most basic instructions the computer can execute, which is operations between 2 number values.

## **Setup**

1. Open a new tab in the Chrome browser by clicking File > New Tab, or pressing `Cmd+T` on Mac or `Ctrl+T` on Windows.
2. Open Chrome Developer Tools by clicking View > Developer > JavaScript Console, pressing `Cmd+Option+I` on Mac or `Ctrl+Shift+I` on Windows, or right-clicking anywhere in Chrome and clicking Inspect.
3. Select the JavaScript Console tab in Chrome Dev Tools.

## Exercises

The JavaScript language is capable of performing math operations. Enter the following calculations into the Chrome Dev Tools Console, followed by the `Enter` key.

```javascript
2 + 2;
```

```javascript
4 * 2;
```

```javascript
4 / 2;
```

```javascript
4 - 2;
```

### Operators

In the above code, `+` `*` `-` and `/` are known as _operators._ Specifically, they are mathematical operators, as the perform a mathematical operation on 2 numbers.  We will soon see other kinds of programming operators and operations; in the next section, we will see the _assignment operator._
