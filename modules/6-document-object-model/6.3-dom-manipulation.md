# 6.3 DOM Manipulation

## Learning Objectives:

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

* [ ] Create, select and manipulate HTML elements using DOM-related methods.

### Inputs and Outputs

The browser is an application that parses HTML code. The code provides basic instructions on the rendering and display of components on the page.

HTML code differs from JavaScript code in that HTML code has no logic, no control flow and doesn't hold data. It simply **describes the way a set of content should be displayed**.

The task of JavaScript is to use the HTML environment to give the users tools to provide input to the program e.g. reading login data, and components to display the output of the program e.g. login success messages.

We have purposely described inputs and outputs very narrowly, but the next step in understanding what a real front-end application does, is to describe all of the **different inputs** that can be given to the program, and all the **different outputs** that can be generated.

**DOM Input - User Action to JS Function Execution**

**JS is capable of taking as input:**

* Any user [mouse movements](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj\_mouseevent.asp) within the browser screen.
* Any elements on the page they've clicked on.
* Any radio buttons, drop-downs, or checkboxes they've selected.
* And more....

**DOM Output - JS to Element to Browser**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/IMG\_0015.PNG)

**JS is capable of giving output as:**

* Any HTML element, with any CSS style applied to it.

The power of JavaScript is that our program can take in and control anything the user does on a browser page.

#### HTML Elements as JavaScript Variables

#### Creating an Output

We can use the DOM to create elements and put them on the page.

```javascript
var coolParagraph = document.createElement('p');
coolParagraph.innerText = 'hey, cool!!!1!';
```

After we've created this element we need to tell the DOM to put it into the page.

```javascript
document.body.appendChild(coolParagraph);
```

#### Grabbing DOM Elements

Using the DOM we can create a JavaScript representation of an element that's on the screen.

Given this element:

```markup
<p id="wow">cool :)</p>
```

We can create a variable that "grabs" it from the DOM.

```javascript
var wowParagraph = document.querySelector('#wow');
```

#### Defining an Input

An input to our JavaScript program is called an **event**. This means we can program the browser in such a way that when the user makes an action, the browser calls our function - and this is exactly how our `main` function works. Except that we aren't just limited to clicking on the submit button or getting the value the user typed into an input field/textbox.

The function for an event is referred to as a _**callback**_ function. In the case of an event listener, the callback function takes the triggered event as an input parameter and does whatever actions it was declared to do due to this trigger. In the example below, the function`myNewMain` is expressed whenever a `click` event is triggered on the `wowParagraph` element. Note the absence of `()` behind the function `myNewMain` as the function is not expressed yet.

```javascript
var myNewMain = function (event) {
  console.log('hey wow my new function');
};

wowParagraph.addEventListener('click', myNewMain);
```

#### Complete Applications with DOM

This level of functionality simply expands the set of tools you have to represent things in your app.

A hand of cards can be represented by a `div` that contains a set of images. Or by a `li` (list) element.

Getting a hold of user actions for a given point in the program can mean many different things.

Hit or stand can mean your program creates a button to be clicked for that given "mode".

## Advanced Applications in the Browser

The pattern of:

1. Being able to create any representation of data on the screen
2. Have complete control over what actions the user can take at any time&#x20;

means that your app should have complete control over every element on the screen.

Modern development for applications that run in the browser ( the browser is the front-end ) are libraries and frameworks that allow programmers to manage all of these elements and inputs.

Some popular libraries include [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org), [Angular](https://angular.io), and [Vue](https://vuejs.org).

## Further Info

### Grab Any Element

To review how element selection works, see the simple examples [on this page.](6.1-html-css-referencing.md)

Look up how to get a reference to any element: [https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met\_document\_queryselector.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met\_document\_queryselector.asp)

### Get Any Input

Look up how to "listen" for any event: [https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met\_document\_addeventlistener.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met\_document\_addeventlistener.asp)

You will also see this syntax:

```javascript
button.addEventListener('click', function () {
  console.log('clicked');
});
```

This syntax sets the function without making a separate variable out of it.

### Make Any Output

Create an element: [https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met\_document\_createelement.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met\_document\_createelement.asp)

Add it to the page with `appendChild`: [https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met\_node\_appendchild.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met\_node\_appendchild.asp)

## Starter Code

The DOM manipulation code in the starter code is inside the `index.html`.

Read through the comments to see what's actually happening.

```markup
<p>
    <input id="starter-ex"/>
</p>
<button id="starter-button">submit me</button>
```

```javascript
// make a variable out of the input and button
var input = document.querySelector('#starter-ex');
var button = document.querySelector('#starter-button');

// call this function
var myButtonClicked = function () {
  // get the current value that's been typed into the input
  var typedValue = input.value;

  // create a new h2
  var newHtwo = document.createElement('h2');

  // set the text inside this new element
  newHtwo.innerText = typedValue;

  // make the h2 appear on screen
  document.body.appendChild(newHtwo);

  // empty out the HTML input
  input.value = '';
};

// say which function to call *when* the user clicks the button
button.addEventListener('click', myButtonClicked);
```

## Exercises

### Follow Along

1. Implement the above code. Start with this repo: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-next-steps-dom](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-next-steps-dom).
2. Using basics-starter-code, write logic that grabs and references HTML elements, and change the background color of the `container` element every time the submit button is clicked. See an example of this [here](https://rocketacademy.github.io/basics-starter-code/dom/colours/index.html).
