# 6.2: The Document Object Model

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

* [ ] Explain the structure and usage of the Document Object Model (DOM).

## Overview

Now we'll describe more about the browser environment we've been working with.

This section is meant as a crash course on the rest of the browser system.

Here we can distinguish between **domain knowledge** - technical knowledge of a specific system, and **general programming knowledge**, which we've been focusing on during this course.

For a different kind of system (a back-end web system, for example, or a mobile device system) we would just have to define a different system of inputs and outputs. The middle section of our program, the equivalent `main` function would still need to do the same actions.

## DOM - Document Object Model

By now you should be familiar that while the browser primarily reads `index.html` , the entire web page that is displayed is built from multiple files together, such as `script.js` and `styles.css`. Data from various sources together define the information and structure of the _document t_hat is processed and displayed by the browser.

The Document Object Model, or DOM, is a _**representation**_ of the contents of a webpage. Specifically, it's a tree-like representation of nodes and objects. By representing the entire document in an object-oriented way, we can use JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the displayed page in a dynamic way.

When we want our JavaScript to take in any inputs from the user or display any outputs on the browser, we have to use some part of the DOM functionality.

When the document is processed by the browser, a set of objects are created that represents the document, along with pre-defined _methods_ and _functions_ that we can use.

We've already seen one: `console.log()`. To be specific, `console` is an _object_ of the DOM created by the browser, which has a pre-defined `.log()` _method._ Other `console` methods include __ `.clear()` __ or `.table()`_._

Besides `console,` the other major objects that represent the DOM are `window` and `document`.

{% hint style="info" %}
Open the console and type in the variable names `window` and `document` to see the values in the console. Click the triangles to the left of the output to see inside them. What is there?

You can use JavaScript object notation to access nested _nodes_ in the document object: try `document.body` or `document.head`, or more generally: `document.children`
