# 4.2: Global Variables

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

* [ ] Use global variables to store game data.

## Introduction

Our programs have so far handled ephemeral _(temporary)_ data that exists only while `main` or the relevant parent function is running. Now we will handle data that _**persists across**_ runs of `main`, and functions in our app in general.

### Global Variables for Dice Guessing

Bank roll or score is an application of the global "counter" variable to our dice game. In the following example, we increment `bankRoll` every time the player correctly guesses the dice roll.

```javascript
// initial bankRoll state
var bankRoll = 10;

var main = function (input) {
  var randomDiceNumber = rollDice();

  var myOutputValue = 'you lose. current bank roll: ' + bankRoll;
  
  // change bankRoll state if the dice matches the randomDice
  if (randomDiceNumber == input) {
    bankRoll = bankRoll + 1;

    myOutputValue = 'you win. current bank roll: ' + bankRoll;
  }

  return myOutputValue;
};
```

## Exercises (Base)

### **App Setup**

```javascript
var rollDice = function () {
  // produces a decimal between 0 and 6
  var randomDecimal = Math.random() * 6;

  // take off the decimal
  var randomInteger = Math.floor(randomDecimal);

  // it's a number from 0 - 5 ... add 1
  var diceNumber = randomInteger + 1;

  return diceNumber;
};

var appSetupMain = function (input) {
  // Attempt the Base: App Setup exercise from the Program Lifecycle and State module below with appSetupMain as the main function.
  var randomDiceNumber = rollDice();

  var myOutputValue = 'you lose';

  if (randomDiceNumber == input) {
    myOutputValue = 'you win';
  }

  return myOutputValue;
};
```

### **Last Roll**

Create a version of the dice game that tells the user what their previous dice roll was.

#### Sample Output

`Your last roll was 4. You just rolled a 3. You guessed 3. You win!`

### **Win / Loss**

As the user continues to play the game, tell them what their current win / loss percentage is.

#### Sample Output

`You win 23.5% of the time. You just rolled a 4. You guessed 3. You lose!`

## Exercises (More Comfortable)

### **Guessing**

If the player guess is off-by-1 they win 1 point. If the player guess is exact they win 2 points.

### **Advanced Guessing**

The player guess can be off by up to 4. If the player guess is off-by-4 they win 1 point. Off-by-3, 2 points, off-by-2, 3 points, off-by-1, 4 points, exact, 5 points.

### **Most Rolled**

{% hint style="warning" %}
While this is achievable with the concepts taught so far, this is a lot more accessible with [arrays](../1-data-types-structures-and-manipulations/1.3-arrays.md).
{% endhint %}

Keep track of the number that's rolled the most times.

#### Sample Output

`You just rolled a 4. 2 is the number you roll the most. You guessed 3. You lose!`
