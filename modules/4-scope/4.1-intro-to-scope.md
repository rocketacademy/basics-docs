## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

* [ ] Define and explain "scope".
* [ ] Be familiar with how variables are declared using `var`, `let`, and `const`.
* [ ] Understand where variables can be accessed depending on where and how they are declared in our code.

## Introduction

In [Module 1](../1-data-types-structures-and-manipulations/1.2-variables.md), we introduced the concept of storing, accessing and manipulating data in the computer's **memory** using **variables**. Modern computers have a lot of memory, and modern programs declare many variables.&#x20;

When writing a large, complex program, or when collaborating with a team, it can be difficult to keep track of which variables have been declared and used, which variables are no longer needed, or the value and meaning of each variable in different contexts of the program. This is where the concept of **scope** comes in handy.

Scope defines _where_ variables can be accessed, referenced and manipulated. If a variable is not "in scope", it cannot be accessed. Which "scope" a variable is in depends on where it is initially declared.

In general, there are 3 types of scope, in the following hierarchy:

1. Global scope
2. Function scope
3. Block scope

## Scope Hierarchy

Variables defined "higher up" the scope hierarchy will be available to reference in "lower" scopes, but not the other way around.&#x20;

Globally-defined variables can be accessed in function scope and block scope, and anywhere else in the program, hence _global._ Variables defined in block scope can only be accessed within that block.

### Global Scope

Any variables defined outside of a function or a block of code exists in global scope. This include function definitions. So `main`, and any other functions we have written are in global scope. This allows us to _call_ the function inside other functions or nested blocks of code.

So far, we have been creating variables inside of a function or a block of code, but nothing is stopping us from creating a variable at the "top level" of `script.js`, in global scope.

Global variables in Coding Basics will persist from **when the program loads** in the browser to when **we close the tab or reload the page**. Try running the following code line by line in Chrome DevTools. The variable `number` persists across our commands, but when we refresh the page, `number` is no longer available.&#x20;

```javascript
var number = 5;
number = number * 2;
number;
```

### Function Scope

Sensibly, variables declared within the function definition exist in function scope. When your program first loads, the functions are defined, but are not yet _executed_ until a function call is made. You can verify this by opening the console, and checking the value of `scopeIntroMain`. We have established that `scopeIntroMain` is defined in global scope, so the browser knows what it is, but attempting to access any variables defined within the function via the console will result in an error.&#x20;

Once the function has been executed, the program returns to the scope from when the function was called, and all the variables declared and used by the program within the function are effectively forgotten. Only the return _value_ persists.&#x20;

Different functions have their own scope. Variables declared in one function are not accessible in another function. Hence we can re-use variable names in many different functions, or more generally, in different scopes.

### Block Scope

Block scoping applies to any variable defined in a block of code within a pair of `{}` using `let`. In Coding Basics, this is mostly blocks of code defined by if-statements.

Similar to Function Scope, once the program exits the block and returns to a higher scope, variables declared within the block are effectively forgotten and inaccessible.&#x20;

## Declaring Variables with \`const\` and \`let\`

In the past we have only used the keyword `var` to declare a variable. We will now introduce `let` and `const` for more control on what can be done with our variables.

* `var` is used for declaring variables in global scope or function scope.
* `let` is used to declaring variables in block scope. Variables declared with `let` are no longer available outside the block. Best used for small temporary variables, i.e. loop counters.
* `const` is used to declare **constants.**  It is similar to `let` in that variables are declared in block scope. Const is used for variables that you do not want to change, i.e. functions, global settings.

## Exercises

### **Follow Along**

Putting it all together:

```javascript
// global scope
var globalVariable = 0

// also global scope
var scopeIntroMain = function (input) {
  // function scope
  console.log(`globalVariable has a value of ${globalVariable}`);
  // we can manipulate the value of a global varaible
  // without having to re-declare using the var keyword:
  globalVariable += 1;
  console.log(`globalVariable now has a value of ${globalVariable}`);
  var myOutputValue;
  if (globalVariable % 2 == 0) {
    // block scope
    // we can access both myOutputValue and globalVariable within block scope
    myOutputValue = `Global variable is even, with a value of ${globalVariable}`;
  }
  else {
    myOutputValue = `Global variable is odd, with a value of ${globalVariable}`;
  }
  return myOutputValue;
};
```

Duplicate and run the code above. Introduce more variables at different scope levels and try accessing them at the global, function, and block scope.&#x20;
