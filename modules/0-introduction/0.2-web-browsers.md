# 0.2: Web Browsers

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the lessons, you should be able to:

* [ ] Explain what a web browser is in your own words.
* [ ] Explain what role browsers play in this course, and why we use them.
* [ ] Make simple edits to an HTML file and see those changes reflected in your browser.

## What is a Web browser?

A web browser is a program used to view and interact with web pages.

### Why learn about web browsers?

In Coding Basics we will use browsers as a learning tool to visualise inputs and outputs of our code through web pages. In general, web browsers are not necessary for writing and executing code.&#x20;

## HTML

Almost all websites are rendered using a markup language called HTML (HyperText Markup Language). Browsers were invented to download and render HTML on computers. The programs we will build in Coding Basics will rely on HTML to accept inputs and visualise outputs.

## Exercises

### Run Starter Code in CodeSandbox

1. Refer to[initial-setup.md](../../course-logistics/setting-up-codesandbox/initial-setup.md "mention") if you have not set up your CodeSandbox environment.
2. Under `day1-data-manipulation > pre-class > index.html`, change line `62` (Basics!) to something else. Saving the file with trigger Hot-Reload, and will refresh the page in the browser automatically.
3. Change the text of the button on line `72`.
