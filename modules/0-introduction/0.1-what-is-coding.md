# 0.1: What is Coding?

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

* [ ] Explain what coding is in your own words.

## Introduction

Coding is the act of writing computer code to form a computer program.

The process of coding includes:

1. Translating a set of input data into a set of abstractions inside a computer
2. Defining what operations the computer performs on that data
3. Determining what output the computer gives and the representation of that output

At their core, all programs, small and large, boil down to this: **instructions to a computer to process an input and give an output**.

## Exercise Questions

1. What are 3 examples of software you use daily that you do not access through your phone, tablet, or laptop?
   1. Examples: An ATM, your rice cooker, an escalator
2. How do you give input to this software, how does it give you output?
3. Define what that input is, what the output is, and what each software is responsible for.
